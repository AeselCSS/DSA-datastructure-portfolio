## Big-O Time Complexity for Queue

| Operation | Time Complexity | Comments                                                                 |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| enqueue   | O(1)            | Adding an element to the end of the queue is a constant-time operation.  |
| dequeue   | O(1)            | Removing an element from the front of the queue is a constant-time operation. |
| peek      | O(1)            | Accessing the front element of the queue is a constant-time operation.   |
| size      | O(1)            | Retrieving the size of the queue is a constant-time operation.           |
| get       | O(n)            | Accessing an element by index requires traversal, hence linear time.     |
